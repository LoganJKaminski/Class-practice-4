/**
 * Name : (Your name here)
 * Course: CSCI 218 - Programming II
 *
 * Todo:
 *
 * Private instance variables to store age of the House, its type (Detached, Semi-Attached, Attached) and its cost.
 *
 * 4 constructors: No argument (sets age to 50, type to Attached and cost to 100000), one argument constructor (sets cost to a value, age - 50 and type - Attached), two argument constructors (sets age to a value, cost to a value , and type to Attached), three argument constructors (sets age to a value, cost to a value, and type to Attached, semi-detached, or detached)
 *
 * 3 Accessor/Getter methods: - methods to return age, type and cost respectively
 *
 * 5 Mutator/Setter methods: - 3 methods for setting the three values independently, a method to set all three values and a method to set age and cost of the house.
 *
 * A public method called estimatePrice() that returns cost of a house based on type and age. An attached cost $100,000, appreciates 1% every year in first five years and 2% every year afterwards. A Semidetached cost $150,000, appreciates 2% every year in first five years and 3% every year afterwards. A detached costs $200,000, appreciates 2% every year in first five years and 2% every year afterwards.
 *
 * A toString() method that returns type of the house and its age and its cost.
 *
 * An equals() method to test for equality of two objects of class House based on type and age.
 *
 * isLessThan() and isGreaterThan() method to compare between the prices of two objects of class House.
 *
 *
 * Hints:
 *  You can generate the toString() method and equals() method body by
